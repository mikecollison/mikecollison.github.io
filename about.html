        <p>My name is Mike Collison. I am a senior at Eastern Washington University earning a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science with minors in Economics and Web Application Development. I have work experience as an IT Pro Assistant and a Computer Lab Consultant. In addition to that, I have experience with videography and photography as well as video &amp; photo editing. My interests in computer science include web application development, Android mobile application development, and embedded real-time control systems. Most of my experience in web application development is with ASP.NET. Currently, I am working on a web application for my Senior Capstone which uses PHP and the Laravel framework.</p>
